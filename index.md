I'm a *scout-leader* at [DPSG-Eningen](http://dpsg-eningen.de/) and *hobby web-developer* looking to change my career into web-development.

My passion is in [offline first](http://offlinefirst.org/) web apps/[PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications). I also strife to make my projects welcoming and easier to start.

You can find my projects [on Github](https://github.com/Terreii/) or in [my portfolio](/portfolio).
