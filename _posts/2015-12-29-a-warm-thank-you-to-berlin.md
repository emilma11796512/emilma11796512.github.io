In September, this year, I visited the web-conference-marathon of <a href="http://rejectjs.org" target="_blank">Reject.js</a>, <a href="http://2015.jsconf.eu/" target="_blank">JSConf.eu</a> and <a href="http://2015.cssconf.eu" target="_blank">CSSConf.eu</a> in Berlin. Which is part of <a href="http://wwwtf.berlin" target="_blank">WhatTheFest</a>.

It was a blast!

But first things first:

For years I have watched the talks on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a>. But I never thought of myself as good enough to attend it.

But one night I read on twitter, how a relatively new programer purchased a ticker for JSConf.eu. And encouraged by this, so did I.

What followed was months of euphoria and self-doubt.

There are no javascript meetings in my area. So this would be my first real meeting with web-developers. And also my first trip to Berlin.

On one of my euphoria moments I also bought a ticket for CSSConf.eu. After all: if there is a day between the two JSConf-days, why not also attend CSSConf? And the Reject.js ticket didn't cost so much, and so it got bought, too.

But the feeling that I wouldn't fit didn't go away.

Almost everything I have written in Javascript is inside an intranet. To have at least a project to show, I startet a <a href="https://github.com/Terreii/andromeda-viewer" target="_blank">chat-client</a>. Most of the days I tried to work a minimum of 30 minutes a day on it. Which I really recommend everyone to do.

But I still had the feeling that my ticket did take away a place for one of the super über Javascript-libery developers. This stayed until I read an <a href="http://www.christophkleinschmidt.de/interview-mit-jan-lehnardt-apache-couchdb-couchdb-apache-org/" target="_blank">interview of one of the organizers of JSConf (in German)</a>. In it Jan Lehnardt stated that they are expecting ~600 Javascript-enthusiastics. Somehow this made me feel good. There is enough room for all. Maybe that he talked about Javascript-enthusiastics not developers also helped …

On Wednesday before Reject.js the organizers invited everyone interested to a local restaurant. I recommend everyone who has the opportunity for such kind of gathering to go and attend it! I met many awesome people that helped me throughout the weekend. Oh and the food was good.

First conference day and minutes in I was warmly greeted by folks I meet last evening. So the ice was already broken.

In the following days it was proven to my that all my fears were false:
<ul>
	<li>I didn't need to prove something to anyone</li>
	<li>All where welcoming and friendly</li>
	<li>There is plenty to talk about</li>
	<li>And everyone is really happy if someone new comes to the community, ever if you are an absolute beginner</li>
	<li>And it is <em>really</em> ok if you never have worked on an open source project</li>
</ul>
In the end I was even encourage to go to <a href="http://2016.jsunconf.eu" target="_blank">JSUnconf.eu</a>. Because I have worked with UDP/Datagram and not many web-developers have done it.

Oh! And the food was fantastic!

Overall the conferences and their attendees create a wonderful atmosphere, where everyone can thrive without having to fear to be excluded.

I only regret not having talked to more people. But there is still JSUnconf and next year!

There is nothing to fear! If you have the chance of visiting a meetup or conference: go! It will transform you!
